The 2022 Fall Parent Survey received 284 responses, representing a 19% response rate. Among those respondents, 84% of parents are __satisfied__ with their students' experiences at Lasell.

# Satisfaction

::: {.cell-output-display}
![](ParentSurvey_files/figure-pdf/report_satis-1.pdf)
:::
:::


Most of parents are satisfied with students' academic experiences, campus life, and most of Lasell services and facilities. The highest satisfaction is in **campus safety**, with 92% of parents satisfied in it. Other aspects that have more than 80% satisfaction rate include: instruction quality, faculty contact with students, campus police, parent engagement, and housing.

However, there are a few services and facilities on campus that receive lower than 65% satisfaction rate, including __dining__, __career counseling__, __mental counseling__, and __social life on campus__.





For dining, many parents complain __food availability and quality__. Parents feel the dining hall lack sufficient supply of food when their students cannot eat in __after-hours__. Parents hope that Lasell can have __more food vendors__ that are available in late hours. Also, parents complain about food quality and the lack of __healthy food__ options. Several parents would like to meet with the food provider or staff members to talk about food options. Some parents suggest Lasell to change to a more student-caring food service provider. Besides, a parent suggest to have __discounted__ meal plans for students who only east twice a day.


# Food Committee (FC)

:::
:::


For the student-run food committee (FC), 79% of parents are __not aware__ of it, and only 7% of parents think their students attended the FC. 42% of parents think their students did not attend the FC because they enjoy the food. 
Other parents comment that their students have __schedule conflict__ for attending the FC. Parents recommend __web form__ as an more accessible and efficient way to give feedback about food.

Another reason for students not attending the FC is the belief that nothing will change no matter what students says in the committee. Parents are upset about the long-exiting complaints about the food, and hope to see if any __actions__ are resulted from the FC. 

51% of parents may be interested in trying Lasell food. Apart from trying the food, some parents request a __meeting__ with the food provider or staff members to talk and offer suggestions about food service at Lasell.






# Information Received

Above 70% of parents are satisfied with information received around events for parents, campus safety, and resources for parents. However, **career counseling** and **off-campus programs** have only 40% satisfaction rate from parents. The **career counseling** also has the most unfulfilled demand, with 46% of parents want more information around career from Lasell.

From parents' comments, we find parents' complaints of the current career services being too general. Parents hope students have __major-specific__ guidance and learn the __process__ of finding a job. Many parents request the career center adviser to offer open discussions with students about __how to identify__ good-fit jobs.





In terms of off-campus programs, a few parents suggest to have __RAs__ involved in promoting campus activities. Also, a parent recommend to have more or promote any existing events that happen in __Boston city__, which could be a good resource to learn.

**Students** are the primary source of information for 76% of parents. Meanwhile, 58% of parents rely on **emails from Lasell** as an information source. Parents discuss most frequently with students about **mental/physical health, academic matters, campus life, and career plans**. Other topics like finances and graduate school plans do not happen as often between parents and students.

The FFA Weekend is the most popular events among parents, as 44% of parents participated in it. Around 10% to 15% of parents attend or will attend the parent receptions and town hall events. For parents who did not participate, __schedule conflict__ is the main reason for missing those events. 

Parents who attended the above events enjoyed the events having __diverse options__ and being __well-organized__. Parents find the these events a good way to __build community__ with other parents and connect to Lasell. A few parents also appreciate the opportunity to __visit the campus__ during in-person events.

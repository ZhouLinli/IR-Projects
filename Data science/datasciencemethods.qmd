##  The Elements of Statistical Learning {auto-animate=true}
- Supervised learning: predicts (classify or regress) an outcome based on some input measures
- Unsupervised learning: cluster (auto-classify) or association (similarity) unlabeled input measures
- Linear methods, regularization & smoothing, additive trees, random forests, neural networks, ensemble learning, and graphical models

## Why regression?

::: {.nonincremental}
+ Regression (i.e. "predictive modeling") is better than hypothesis testing 
::: 
- more than test significance of a statistics, but also estimate magnitudes of effects
- models may be used to incorporate complex sampling/ measurements and conduct many different statistical tests ("Prediction -- a superset of hypothesis testing and estimation")

::: {.fragment .highlight-blue}
+ Multivariable regression/modeling is even better: it contains important variables and controls them constant so we can estimate absolute effects of the variable of interest.
:::
::: {.column-margin}
____
Note: There are two types of hypothesis testing: 1) Parametric/rank test that assume sample comes from a certain probability distribution and calculate p-value as the probability of the occurrence of a given test statistic; and 2) Permutation test that randomly sample (without replacement) possible permutations and calculate p-value as the proportion of samples that have a test statistic more extreme than our initial/observed test statistic
